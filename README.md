# REST API Example

This example shows how to implement a **REST API with TypeScript** using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client). The example uses an SQLite database file with some initial dummy data which you can find at [`./prisma/dev.db`](./prisma/dev.db).

## Getting started

`pnpm install`
`docker compose up -d`
`pnpm prisma migrate reset`
`pnpm run dev`
